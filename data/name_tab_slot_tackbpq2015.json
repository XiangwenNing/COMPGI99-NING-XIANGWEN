United Sugars is co-owned by American Crystal Sugar Co.\n\nJohnson said he hopes to hire back another 15 or 16 seasonal workers this summer.\n\nAbout 1,300 sugar workers had been locked out of their jobs in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa since August 2011 after the union rejected a company contract offer.

United Sugars is co-owned by American Crystal Sugar Co.\n\nJohnson said he hopes to hire back another 15 or 16 seasonal workers this summer.\n\nAbout 1,300 sugar workers had been locked out of their jobs in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa since August 2011 after the union rejected a company contract offer.
