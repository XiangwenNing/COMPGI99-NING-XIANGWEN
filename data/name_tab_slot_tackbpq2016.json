Now, two and a half years later of saying everything was fine with the US military and Iraq on the verge of total collapse, Bush uses this idea for cover to accomplish something it was never meant to do - keep us in Iraq. If the greater numbers were even the answer to Iraq, they won't be on line until 2008.

The man is crazy.\n</post>\n<post author=\"aristobrat\" datetime=\"2006-12-20T",
